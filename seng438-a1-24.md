# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Mushtaba & Parbir:

* We intend to test the system by simulating how the ATM machine would react to an individual using the system who could input correct and or incorrect inputs. The unfamiliar and unpredictable nature of our test cases are intended to also simulate how an individual could use the system in the real world, which makes sure that we single out all unintended behaviours/outputs. For instance, our test cases will include both common and likely paths that individuals would take while using the system, such as inserting their card, entering their pin, and depositing/withdrawing cash. However, our test cases also will also include some exceptional paths that could be intentionally/accidentally taken, such as pressing buttons that should result in no action, attempting to withdraw cash with no money in the ATM, or continually entering incorrect pin numbers. In addition, we will also test whether or not the ATM system retains the correct balances after withdrawing/depositing from and into accounts.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
