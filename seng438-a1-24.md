# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Mushtaba & Parbir:

* We intend to test the system by simulating how the ATM machine would react to an individual using the system who could input correct and or incorrect inputs. The unfamiliar and unpredictable nature of our test cases are intended to also simulate how an individual could use the system in the real world, which makes sure that we single out all unintended behaviours/outputs. For instance, our test cases will include both common and likely paths that individuals would take while using the system, such as inserting their card, entering their pin, and depositing/withdrawing cash. However, our test cases also will also include some exceptional paths that could be intentionally/accidentally taken, such as pressing buttons that should result in no action, attempting to withdraw cash with no money in the ATM, or continually entering incorrect pin numbers. In addition, we will also test whether or not the ATM system retains the correct balances after withdrawing/depositing from and into accounts.

Ahad & Athul: 

Our exploratory testing plan included testing the ATM functionality in Appendix B (High Level Requirements). The first test involved testing all multiples of $20 withdrawals from the menu. We ensured each an every option in the menu worked, was a multiple of $20.00 and correctly withdrew the correct amount when looking at the receipt. The next overarching test involved ensuring a customer was able to make a deposit into the account and again ensuring the ATM system correctly deposited the correct amount when looking at the receipt. In the test, we also ensured the customer was able to accept and view the envelope. The third test was ensuring that a transfer of money between any two accounts linked to the card could be made. This meant we ensured that a user can for example transfer money from their savings to checking account if both accounts exist and the savings account in this case had sufficient funds. The fourth test we conducted was making a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card, which meant to ensure all accounts avaialble to the user accurately reflected the correct balance. Our fifth and final test ensured we were able to abort a transaction in progress by pressing the Cancel key rather than proceeding with the transaction.
