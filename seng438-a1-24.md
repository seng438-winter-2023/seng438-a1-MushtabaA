# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Mushtaba & Parbir:

* We intend to test the system by simulating how the ATM machine would react to an individual using the system who could input correct and or incorrect inputs. The unfamiliar and unpredictable nature of our test cases are intended to also simulate how an individual could use the system in the real world, which makes sure that we single out all unintended behaviours/outputs. For instance, our test cases will include both common and likely paths that individuals would take while using the system, such as inserting their card, entering their pin, and depositing/withdrawing cash. However, our test cases also will also include some exceptional paths that could be intentionally/accidentally taken, such as pressing buttons that should result in no action, attempting to withdraw cash with no money in the ATM, or continually entering incorrect pin numbers. In addition, we will also test whether or not the ATM system retains the correct balances after withdrawing/depositing from and into accounts.

Ahad & Athul: 

* Our exploratory testing plan included testing the ATM functionality in Appendix B (High Level Requirements). The first test involved testing all multiples of $20 withdrawals from the menu. We ensured each an every option in the menu worked, was a multiple of $20.00 and correctly withdrew the correct amount when looking at the receipt. The next overarching test involved ensuring a customer was able to make a deposit into the account and again ensuring the ATM system correctly deposited the correct amount when looking at the receipt. In the test, we also ensured the customer was able to accept and view the envelope. The third test was ensuring that a transfer of money between any two accounts linked to the card could be made. This meant we ensured that a user can for example transfer money from their savings to checking account if both accounts exist and the savings account in this case had sufficient funds. The fourth test we conducted was making a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card, which meant to ensure all accounts avaialble to the user accurately reflected the correct balance. Our fifth and final test ensured we were able to abort a transaction in progress by pressing the Cancel key rather than proceeding with the transaction.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Our team used Discord as the primary communication medium for Assignment 1. Therefore, through scheduled discord meetings the lab work was split between the two pairs.

The two pairs for the purpose of this lab were:
* Ahad and Athul (Pair 1)
* Mushtaba and Parbir (Pair 2)

For exploratory testing, Partner 1 (Ahad and Mushtaba) acted as the tester and shared their screen with version 1.0 of the ATM system. Meanwhile, Partner 2 (Athul and Parbir) acted as the developer and created issues or bug reports in the Jira application. Partner 1 and Partner 2 both shared their screen during virtual meetings to ensure efficiency and accuracy during the exploratory testing purpose. For Pair 1, both members came up with the exploratory testing plan together based on the requirements outlined in Appendix B, while for Pair 2, Partner 1 (Mushtaba) created the exploratory testing plan.

After both pairs completed exploratory testing, for manual scripted testing, Pair 1 took up the first 20 test cases from Appendix C, while Pair 2 took up the next 20 test cases from Appendix C. This time Partner 2 acted as the developer while Partner 1 acted as the tester. This ensured all members of team had a chance to act as both tester and developer. During this phase of testing, if a bug was found in the test case but was already found in exploratory testing, the bug report would be updated to notify developers or viewers that the bug was found in both phases of testing. If the bug was not previously reported, Partner 1 would instead create a new bug report.

Finally, for regression testing, both pairs ensured to test all the bug reports in the exploratory testing phase and test all 20 test cases from the manual scripted testing phase again but for Version 1.1 of the ATM system. When testing the bug reports from the exploratory testing phase, Partner 1 assumed the role of tester and Parter 2 assumed the role of developer as was the case with version 1.0. For manual scripted testing, the roles were reversed, as was the case with version 1.0. If a bug persisted or was only partially resolved in this version, the status changed from TODO to IN PROGRESS and the description was also updated. In addition, the "Affects Version" field was also updated. However, if the bug was resolved, then the status changed to DONE and the "Fix Version" field was updated. Finally, if a new bug was found, then a new bug report was created.
